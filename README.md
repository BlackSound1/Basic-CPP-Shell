# Basic C++ Shell

![Shell Screenshot](/images/ShellScreenshot.png)

This is a minimum viable product for a basic terminal shell. It is written in C++.

Compiled with C++17 using MSVC.

It is modeled after Bash.

## Features

- **Builtin Commands**. This basic shell supports the following builtins:
  - `exit`: Exit the shell with a specified status code. Ex: `exit 1`.
  - `pwd`: Print the current working directory. Ex: `pwd`.
    - `cd`: Change the current working directory. Ex: `cd ../`, `cd ~`, `cd /d/Documents`.
  - `echo`: Print text to the terminal. Ex: `echo "Hello World"`.
 Supports typical Bash behavior for single and double quotes, as well as escape sequences. Interpolation not supported.
  - `type`:
    - If the argument is a builtin, displays that to the screen.
    - If the argument is not a builtin, displays the path to the program, if it exists.
    - If the argument is not a builtin or a program, displays an error message.
- **Other commands**. If the command is not a builtin, it is assumed to be a program and is executed.

## Usage

Compile (with at least C++17) and run the program. A shell will then be started.
Type any of the above commands and any arguments you want.
